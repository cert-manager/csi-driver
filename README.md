# cert-manager-csi


cert-manager-csi is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver plugin for
Kubernetes to work along [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). The goal
for this plugin is to facilitate requesting and mounting certificate key
pairs to pods seamlessly. This is useful for facilitating mTLS, or otherwise
securing connections of pods with guaranteed present certificates whilst
having all of the features that cert-manager provides.

This project is experimental.

## Why a CSI Driver?

- Ensure private keys never leave the node and are never sent over the network.
  All private keys are stored locally on the node.
- Unique key and certificate per application replica with a grantee to be
  present on application run time.
- Reduce resource management overhead by defining certificate request spec
  in-line of the Kubernetes Pod template.
- Automatic renewal of certificates based on expiry of each individual
  certificate.
- Keys and certificates are destroyed during application termination.
- Scope for extending plugin behaviour with visibility on each replica's
  certificate request and termination.

## Requirements and Installation

This CSI driver plugin makes use of the 'CSI inline volume' feature - Alpha as
of `v1.15` and beta in `v1.16`. Kubernetes versions `v1.16` and higher require
no extra configuration however `v1.15` requires the following feature gate set:
```
--feature-gates=CSIInlineVolume=true
```

You must have a working installation of cert-manager present on the cluster.
Instructions on how to install cert-manager can be found
[here](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/install/kubernetes.html).

To install the cert-manager-csi driver, apply the deployment manifests to your
cluster.

```
 $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cert-manager-csi-driver.yaml
```

You can verify the installation has completed correctly by checking the presence
of the CSIDriver resource as well as a CSINode resource present for each node,
referencing `csi.cert-manager.io`.

```
$ kubectl get csidrivers
NAME                     CREATED AT
csi.cert-manager.io   2019-09-06T16:55:19Z

$ kubectl get csinodes -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: CSINode
  metadata:
    name: kind-control-plane
    ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Node
      name: kind-control-plane
...
  spec:
    drivers:
    - name: csi.cert-manager.io
      nodeID: kind-control-plane
      topologyKeys: null
...
```

The CSI driver is now installed and is ready to be used for pods in the cluster.

## Requesting and Mounting Certificates

To request certificates from cert-manager, simply define a volume mount where
the key and certificate will be written to, along with a volume with attributes
that define the cert-manager request. The following is a dummy app that mounts a
key certificate pair to `/tls` and has been signed by the `ca-issuer` with a
DNS name valid for `my-service.sandbox.svc.cluster.local`.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-csi-app
  namespace: sandbox
  labels:
    app: my-csi-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-frontend
      image: busybox
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/tls"
        name: tls
      command: [ "sleep", "1000000" ]
  volumes:
    - name: tls
      csi:
        driver: csi.cert-manager.io
        volumeAttributes:
              csi.cert-manager.io/issuer-name: ca-issuer
              csi.cert-manager.io/dns-names: my-service.sandbox.svc.cluster.local
```

Once created, the CSI driver will generate a private key locally, request a
certificate from cert-manager based on the given attributes, then store both
locally to be mounted to the pod. The pod will remain in a pending state until
this process has been completed.

For more information on how to set up issuers for your cluster, refer to the
cert-manager documentation
[here](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/index.html).

## Supported Volume Attributes

The cert-manager-csi driver aims to have complete feature parity with all
possible values available through the cert-manager API however currently supports
the following values;
